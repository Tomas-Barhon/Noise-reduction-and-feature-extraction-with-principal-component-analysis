\chapter{Data}
\label{chap:three}

Compared to traditional financial data cryptocurrency data tend to be easier
to obtain. However, many data providers have already identified the bussiness 
potential of selling advanced data and have started to monetize them. However,
since some
websites monetize only their APIs we could improvize and obtain data from 
multiple sources and merge them to get to our desired dataset size. We have
desired to use as many relevant variables as possible and we build on
an existing research in the field.
Our dataset can be split into 2 main categories and 4 subcategories.
We utilize the data that describe the overall market trends in the traditional
sense. These data were mostly obtained from \textbf{\href{https://fred.stlouisfed.org/}{https://fred.stlouisfed.org/}}
and from the 
\textbf{\href{https://finance.yahoo.com/markets/}{https://finance.yahoo.com/markets/}} API.
To balance fundamental indicators with speculative side we used \textbf{\href{https://trends.google.com/trends/}{Google Trends}}
and \textbf{\href{https://pageviews.wmcloud.org/}{Wikipedia Page Views}} 
that act as a proxy for market attention about cryptocurrencies in general 
and should help us to model the market hype periods. These explanatory
variables are then used to forecast the price or returns of the specific cryptocurrency
of interest lagged back in time.

    \label{fig:dataset_description}
\end{figure}


The data were collected between December 2023 to February 2024 varying 
based on
the different sources but they are further shortened to utilize the most
overlapping region between data sources for each unique cryptocurrency.
This results in a time series from 17.9.2014 to 1.11.2022 for Bitcoin, 4.2.2016
to 27.7.2022 for Ethereum ensuring that the end of the series is 
before the change to proof-of-stake algorithm and series from 17.9.2014 to 1.11.2022
for Litecoin. The shifted versions of the datasets are of variable length based
on the forecasting horizon. 
\section{Cryptocurrency Specific Technical Data}

Despite the fact, that we have framed this data as fundamental/technical 
we should acknowledge that fundamental in our case stands far from its 
traditional meaning. They are fundamental in a way that they 
are the typical data researchers and practitioners employ to model cryptocurrencies
and that they objectively describe the system.
However, as the fundamental factor is very limited in this case it only makes sense
for the typical variables such as capitalization, volatility, hashrate and others.
But we also used a lot of technical variables that are derived from these fundamental
variables or the price itself. These help to identify trends in certain 
variables from pure mathematical transformation of the original series. 
All of these data were collected from \textbf{\href{https://coinmetrics.io/}{coinmetrics.io}}
and further processed by our pipeline.




\section{Macroeconomical Data}

As the macroeconomical condition is a cruical factor for investor behaviour 
we decided to include relevant variables that might deliver valuable
insights. We utilize five macroeconomical indicators that affect invesment choices.
Real Gross Domestic product of the United States represents the overall
growth trend of the largest economy in the world with closely related real
gross domestic product per capita telling more about individual resouces which
gives a more complex picture of the state of the US economy despite the 
fact that americans are not the main cryptocurrency investors by nation.
Furthermore we incorporate Consumer Price Index in the United States that
acts as an inflationary measure to capture the spurious correlation between 
prices of USD and BTC-USD exchange rate. M2 base acts as a measure
of dollar liquidity in the circulation. Lastly, the USD-EUR exchange rate
can be thought of as a market state information or its returns as an 
opportunity costs for potential investors. To further adress the problem of spurious
correlation and add the information about growth of other markets we include
various closing prices and other measures of the stock market and other 
investment opportunities. 


Following is the full description of the macroeconomical
variables used:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textit{Close\_DJI} - Dow Jones Industrial Average
    \item \textit{Close\_GSPC} - S\&P 500
    \item \textit{Close\_GC=F} - Gold Futures
    \item \textit{Close\_VIX} - CBOE Volatility Index
    \item \textit{Close\_IXIC} - NASDAQ Composite
    \item \textit{Close\_SMH} - VanEck Semiconductor ETF
    \item \textit{Close\_VGT} - Vanguard Information Technology Index Fund
    \item \textit{Close\_XSD} - SPDR S\&P Semiconductor ETF
    \item \textit{Close\_IYW} - iShares U.S. Technology ETF
    \item \textit{Close\_FTEC} - Fidelity MSCI Information Technology Index ETF
    \item \textit{Close\_IGV} - iShares Expanded Tech-Software Sector ETF
    \item \textit{Close\_QQQ} - Invesco QQQ Trust
    \item \textit{RGDP\_US} - Real Gross Domestic Product of the United States
    \item \textit{RGDP\_PC\_US} - Real Gross Domestic Product per capita 
    of the United States
    \item \textit{CPI\_US} - Consumer Price Index: All Items: Total for United States
    \item \textit{M2\_US} - M2 Base US
    \item \textit{USD\_EUR\_rate} - U.S. Dollars to Euro Spot Exchange Rate
\end{itemize}


\section{Web Search Data}

As mentioned earlier following many other researchers we aimed to 
obtain a proxy for the market
attention. We specifically used \textbf{\href{https://pageviews.wmcloud.org/}{Wikipedia Page Views}}
to get the page views for Wikipedia pages: Bitcoin, Ethereum, Litecoin and 
Cryptocurrency and use them respectively for each coin dataset combining 
the overall Cryptocurrency views with the specific currency. Similarly we 
hoped to obtain similar data from 
\textbf{\href{https://trends.google.com/trends/}{Google Trends}} but they
turned out to be quite cumbersome to use. As \cite{West2020a} mentioned 
there are three main obstacles when using Google Trends. Firstly, the scale
is always normalized into the range 0-100 based on the selected region and time.
Secondly, this implicitly means that the results are rounded to integers and thus 
loosing a lot of precision. Lastly, there is a limit of 5 queries that you can 
use at a time. This not only means that you cannot compare more search terms 
but it also means that when there are over five variations how the term might
be searched for one cannot do that effectively. Another problem, 
that we faced is that the data can be obtained only in weekly granularity
for longer periods and thus needs to be interpolated to daily which 
most likely sacrifices a lot of interesting dynamics on the daily level which
is significant regarding the volatility of cryptocurrencies. 
These reasons, except the weekly sampling frequency, were solved in 
the \textbf{\href{https://github.com/epfl-dlab/GoogleTrendsAnchorBank}{g-tab}}
Python library, created by \cite{West2020a}, which uses a 
two step query sampling process that 
estimates the searches on a universally common scale with floating precision and allows 
us to use as many word formulation as needed. We would then sum the popularity
for each word formulation that is related to the same thing. We acknowledge
that there is a risk that we ommited some word formulations but hopefully
we covered all the significant ones.


Following is the list of the variables from this section and their word forms
for Google Trends:
https://cs.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitcoin
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textit{Wiki\_btc\_search} - Wiki pageviews for \textbf{\href{https://cs.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitcoin}{Bitcoin}}
    \item \textit{Wiki\_eth\_search} - Wiki pageviews for \textbf{\href{https://cs.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethereum}{Ethereum}}
    \item \textit{Wiki\_ltc\_search} - Wiki pageviews for \textbf{\href{https://cs.wikipedia.org/wiki/Litecoin}{Litecoin}}
    \item \textit{Wiki\_crypto\_search} - Wiki pageviews for \textbf{\href{https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptocurrency}{Cryptocurrency}}
    \item \textit{Google\_btc\_search} - Google Trends summed from terms: \textit{Bitcoin, bitcoin, BTC}
    \item \textit{Google\_eth\_search} - Google Trends summed from terms: \textit{Ethereum, ethereum, ether, ETH}
    \item \textit{Google\_ltc\_search} - Google Trends summed from terms: \textit{Litecoin, litecoin, LTC}
    \item \textit{Google\_crypto\_search} - Google Trends summed from terms: \textit{Cryptocurrency, cryptocurrency, Cryptocurrencies, cryptocurrencies, crypto, Crypto}
\end{itemize}

To achieve compatibility with PDF/A 2u, your file must not include links to external fonts, audio, video, or scripts. On the other hand, your file must declare each color environment you use, it must include all the pictures/figures either in jpeg or PDF/A 2u format, used fonts compliant under Unicode (your file cannot use any external fonts), and it must include meta-data in XMP format.


Most troubleshooting comes from the conversion of figures to compliant formats. You can convert from simple PDF using Adobe Acrobat:



But most of the vector graphics gets distorted to lower quality in Adobe (like pictures in pdfs generated from Stata, unless jpeg is sufficient for you). You can also use GhostScript, the conversion tool is provided by courtesy of the Faculty of Mathematics and Physics at
